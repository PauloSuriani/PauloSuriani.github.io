      things works lead me into technology. I'm also on music, 
      gardening, reading, creative activities.

      Hello world! My name is Paulo, 
      borned at '88 and since then I've always been curious about 
      computers.  
      
      Traveled into algorithym and
      recursiveness. 

      Although my first experience with a computer was typing 
      on a MS-DOS terminal, and I was officaly introduced to Computer Science at
      2006, through logics, maths. Last year I've been practicing and learning 
      about web development. I've done about 30 projects in a journey including 
      technologies like: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Docker, SQL, NodeJs,
      TypeScript, 

      tools like React to create web pages and 
      cook with Node.js + Express to build robust back-ends.
      It's simple like that. Clean code. 

      and although I didn't 
      have a bachelors degree
